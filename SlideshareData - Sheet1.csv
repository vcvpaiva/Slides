 Abstract: Dialectica Categories (also known as dialectica spaces), the main construction of my phd thesis, have had several (unrelated) applications. I've used them to model Linear Logic, FILL(Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic), the Lambek Calculus and classes of Petri Nets (with C. Brown and D. Gurr). They were also used to model state in programming language semantics, after U. Reddy (with M. Correa and H. Hausler), and fuzzy Petri nets (with A. Syropoulos) and several 'superpower games' (A. Blass). Recently Mihai Budiu, Joel Galenson and Gordon Plotkin used dialectica categories in the modelling of partial compilers. I want to discuss this application, presented in the preprint ""The Compiler Forest"" (#90), available from Plotkin's webpage, to see if I understand it. Since I know little about compilers, audience participation will be very welcome!",,presentation,en,public,500,496,4,1,4,2

 whatever you say to them they translate into their own language and forthwith it is something entirely different."" True. Even more true of category theorists.

 Title: Natural Language Inference for Humans
 
 Valeria de Paiva, 
 
 Topos Institute, Berkeley, USA
 
 
 
 Abstract: One hears much about the incredible results of recent neural nets methods in NLP. In particular much has been made of the results on the Natural Language Inference task using the huge new corpora SNLI, MultiNLI, SciTail, etc, constructed since 2015. Wanting to join in the fun, we decided to check the results on the corpus SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge), which is two orders of magnitude smaller than SLNI and presumably easier to deal with. 
 
 We discovered that there were many results that did not agree with our intuitions. As a result, we have written so far five papers on the subject (with another one submitted to COLING2020). 
 
 I want to show you a potted summary of this work, to explain why we think this work is not near completion yet and how we're planning to tackle it.

 Dialectica categories for the Lambek calculus
 
 Valeria de Paiva
 
 The Topos Institute, Berkeley, CA
 
 
 
 Abstract:
 
 
 
  Dialectica categorical models of the Lambek Calculus were first presented in the Amsterdam Colloquium a long time ago. Following Lambek's lead, we approached the Lambek Calculus from the perspective of Linear Logic and adapted the Dialectica categorical models for Linear Logic to Lambek's non-commutative calculus. The old work took for granted the syntax of the Lambek calculus and only discussed the exciting possibilities of new models for the modalities that Linear Logic introduced. Many years later we find that the work on dialectica models of the Lambek calculus is still interesting and that it might inform some of the most recent work on the relationship between Categorial Grammars and notions of Distributional Semantics.
 
 Thus we revisited the old work, making sure that the syntax details that were sketchy on the first version got completed and verified, using automated tools such as Agda and Ott. Ultimately we are interested in the applicability of the original systems to their intended uses in the construction of semantics of Natural Language. But before we can discuss it, we need to make sure that the mathematical properties that make the Lambek calculus attractive are all properly modeled and this is the main aim of this paper. 
 
 
 
 We recall the Lambek calculus with its Curry-Howard isomorphic term assignment system. We extend it with a $\kappa$ modality, inspired by Yetter's work, which makes the calculus commutative. Then we add the of-course modality $!$, as Girard did, re-introducing weakening and contraction for all formulas and get back the full power of intuitionistic and classical logic. We also present algebraic semantics and categorical semantics, proved sound and complete for the whole system. Finally, we show the traditional properties of type systems, like subject reduction, the Church-Rosser theorem and normalization for the calculi of extended modalities, which we did not have before.","lambek calculus,type theory,categorical models",presentation,en,public,114,108,6,0,0,2

 Dialectica Categories: the mathematical version
 
 
 
 Abstract: I will give a potted summary of the more mathematical version of Dialectica Categories which were introduced some 30 years ago. Dialectica categories were used to produce models of Linear Logic, inspired by Goedel‚Äôs original Dialectica Interpretation (1958), but many more applications were introduced by others. 
 
 Dialectica categories are described in the technical report from Cambridge (‚ÄúThe Dialectica Categories‚Äù, TR213, https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf, 1990) if you want to read ahead, but this is not necessary. Some of the applications are described in https://github.com/vcvpaiva/DialecticaCategories. However, in this talk, we will only discuss the mathematics of the constructions.
